## How to install:
**Using pip command:** \
``
pip install hypixelpy 
``

**From Source Code:** \
``
pip install git+https://github.com/cinget/hypixelpy.git#egg=hypixelpy

## How to use:
After installing it, run this simple code to see if everything is working:
```python
from hypixelpy.hypixel import Hypixel # importing the library


test = Hypixel(key='PUT YOUR HYPIXEL KEY HERE') # The Hypixel class requires an API key to work
print(test.api.key_information()) # prints all the information from the given key
```

You should get an output like this:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "record": {
    "key": "YOUR KEY",
    "owner": "YOUR MINECRAFT UUID",
    "limit": 120,
    "queriesInPastMin": 1,
    "totalQueries": 364
  }
}
```
