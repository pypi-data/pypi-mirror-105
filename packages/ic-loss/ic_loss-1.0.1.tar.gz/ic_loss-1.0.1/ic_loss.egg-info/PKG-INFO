Description: ## Inverse Contrastive Loss
        
        Implementations of inverse contrastive loss from [Learning Invariant Representations using Inverse Contrastive Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08343). The model architecture used on the ADNI dataset in the paper is also included along with PyTorch and Tensorflow implementations of the loss function.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install ic-loss
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        import torch
        from ic_loss.losses import icl, icl_tf # icl - pytorch, icl_tf - tensorflow
        from ic_loss.models import ADNIResNet # ADNIResNet - pytroch model used in the paper
        
        model = ADNIResNet()
        
        x = torch.randn([1, 1, 512, 512])
        logits, latent = model(x)
        
        loss = icl(latent, c) # c - extraneous attribute 
        
        ```
