        SVG diagram creation from Python code - **pinout** provides an easy method of creating pin-out diagrams for electronic hardware.

        Please visit [pinout.readthedocs.io](https://pinout.readthedocs.io) for the full *quick start* tutorial and detailed documentation on all options provided by the *pinout* package.
        
        ## Quick start
        
        *pinout* can be easily installed with pip and provides some sample files that demonstrate key features. 
        
        ### Install
        
        Using a virtual environment is recommended; Start by installing the *pinout* package. Either clone this repo and pip install it or install from PyPi:
        ```
        pip install pinout
        
        # Or upgrade to the latest version
        pip install --upgrade pinout
        ```
        
        ### Duplicate sample files
        
        A normal pinout diagram will ultimately include an SVG file, an image of hardware to be documented, and a stylesheet that provides unique styles to the diagram. Duplicate the sample files from the *pinout* package by launch a command line at the location you intend to work and enter the following:
        ```python
        py -m pinout.file_manager --duplicate quick_start
        
        # expected output:
        # >>> quick_start_board.png duplicated.
        # >>> quick_start_config.yaml duplicated.
        # >>> quick_start_pinout.py duplicated.
        # >>> quick_start_styles.css duplicated.
        ```
        
        Once you have these file a finished diagram can be generated by running the python script from a command line `py quick_start_pinout.py`. An SVG file is created and can be conveniently view in a browser.
