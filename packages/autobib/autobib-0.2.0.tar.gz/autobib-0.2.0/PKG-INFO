Description: # autobib
        
        Automatically generate and manage a BibTeX file.
        
        `autobib` will automatically fetch citation keys from online repositories that were added to the LaTeX document but not yet to the `.bib` file. The automatically fetched entries are added to the local `.bib` file for the next run. For this to work, the citation key has to be the Inspire key.
        
        In essence, you still need to look up a citation online, but you don't have to add it twice, to your LaTeX document and to your `.bib` file. `autobib` does the latter for you.
        
        ## Installation and usage
        
        `pip install autobib`
        
        This installs a new script called `bibtex`, which is a drop-in replacement of the original `bibtex` command. The same name is chosen to make it work automatically with tooling like `latexmk`, which is otherwise hard to achieve.
        
        Make sure that the `bibtex` script installed by `autobib` is found first by shell lookup. The path where the script is located must come first in the search paths listed by `PATH`, before the original `bibtex`.
        
        ## Planned features
        
        - Also fetch from [adsabs](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/)
        - Smart-detect duplicates with some similarity metric, e.g. if the same paper is cited once using the adsabs key and once using the Inspire key
