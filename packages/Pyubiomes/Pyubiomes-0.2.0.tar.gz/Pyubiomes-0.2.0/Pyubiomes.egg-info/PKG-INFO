        ## Introduction
        Pyubiomes is a (relatively) easy to use, easy to understand wrapper for the Cubiomes C library and a few more libraries. This project is still a wip, so please mention bugs/improvements. 
        
        If you have any problems, look at the documentation, then ask on the discord server. Do not make a new issue. I will likely not see it.
        
        This module requires [minecraft_nether_gen_rs](https://github.com/SeedFinding/minecraft_nether_generation_rs)'s Python binding for the nether utilities
