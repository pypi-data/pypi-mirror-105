    """Create a scope to be used in the computation of cumulative aggregations.

    Cumulative aggregations include cumulative sums (also called running sum or prefix sum), mean, min, max, etc.

    Args:
        level: The level along which the aggregation is performed.
        dense: When ``True``, all members of the level, even those with no value for the underlying measure, will be taken into account for the cumulative aggregation (resulting in repeating values).
        partitioning: The levels in the hierarchy at which to start the aggregation over.
        window: The custom aggregation window.
            The window defines the set of members before and after a given member (using the level comparator) to be considered in the computation of the cumulative aggregation.

            The window can be a:

            * ``range`` starting with a <=0 value and ending with a >=0 value.

               By default the window is ``range(-âˆž, 0)``, meaning that the value for a given member is computed using all of the members before it and none after it.
            * time period as a two-element tuple starting with an offset of the form ``-xxDxxWxxMxxQxxY`` or ``None`` and ending with an offset of the form ``xxDxxWxxMxxQxxY`` or ``None``.

              For instance, to compute the 5 previous days sliding mean::

                m2 = atoti.agg.mean(m1, scope=tt.scope.cumulative("date", window=("-5D", None)))
