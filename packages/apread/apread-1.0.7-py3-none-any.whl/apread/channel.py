class Channel:
    """
    Holds data of a Catman Channel.    

    Information:
            APReader uses the Channel-Lengths to connect Channels together.
            Say there are two Channels with Length 100, then one of those will have "Time" in its name.
            The other one then gets a reference to the "time" one.
            
            If there is more than one channel having the same amount of entries, every channel will 
            get the same reference to the time channel.
