# Image_Search

Simple image search that can search most filetypes*. It can use google or bing for image search and, there are filters you can use. Search tags are located in Search_Tags.py

\*Google search is only for jpegs for now and bing search has not been tested for all filetypes only for jpegs, pngs, and gifs.

also ignore the commit comments I am really bad at them.
