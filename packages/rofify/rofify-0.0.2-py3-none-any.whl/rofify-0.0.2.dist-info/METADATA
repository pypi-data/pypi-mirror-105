# Rofify
## Spotify Menu in Rofi
This app is intended to provide an alternative method for controlling spotify playback. 
It's inspired by the terminal application [SpoTUI](https://github.com/ceuk/SpoTUI), and makes heavy use of 
[spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy) and [python-rofi-menu](https://github.com/miphreal/python-rofi-menu).

Before you attempt to install this, it's worth noting that, at present, you need spotify premium in order to use this. 

To install the package run: 
``` sh
pip install rofify
```

## Configuration
You will need to add a few items to the configuration to get started.



Try and see if the package is working by typing running Rofi:
``` sh
rofi -modi spotify:"python -m rofify" -show spotify
```
