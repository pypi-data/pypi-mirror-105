        Simple replay manager for the game Project+, compatible with Linux and macOS
        
        ## Installation
        Just grab the AppImage/mac App with Python and the dependencies bundled from the [releases](https://github.com/MininuxDev/mininux-replay-manager/releases/)
        
        You can also install with pip (>= python3.6 required):
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/MininuxDev/mininux-replay-manager.git
        cd mininux-replay-manager
        pip3 install --user .  # To install only for your user
        sudo pip3 install . # To install for your whole system (not recommended)
        ```
        
        Running the module directly from the repo seems to work, but you need to have PySide2 installed
