Description: # Mock SAP Data Intelligence api
        
        This small package can be used to mock the api-package of SAP Data Intelligence in order to develop an operator locally. 
        It is assumed that the working directory has the SAP Data Intelligence vflow-structure (github-pull) and the 
        Python-operator has been created previously with the 'Create Operator'-wizzard of the modeler. For details a blog
         will be published on SAP Community in May 2021. 
         
        To use the this add at the beginning of your script the following codelines: 
        
        ```
        try:
            api
        except NameError:
            from utils.di_local_test import *
        ```
        
        The following api attributes will be mocked: 
        
        * **config**: with the attributes read from the operators.json-file
        * **Message**: creating a Message with attributes and body as attributes
        * **send**: prints the content of the message that is send to the port. Only the message data types `string' and 'message' are 
        currently supported.
