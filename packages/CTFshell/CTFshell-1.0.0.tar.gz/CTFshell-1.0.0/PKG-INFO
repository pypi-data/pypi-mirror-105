        in a simple and easy-to-use CLI.

        Usage
        -----
        To register on the server use the 'register' command, providing a
        maximum 32 character username.
        
        .. code-block::
        
                > register example_user
                success!
                user uuid: dae72401-b760-43e0-a188-d45556f0a7ff
                saved.
                >
        
        To view the flags use the 'flags' command.
        
        .. code-block::
        
                > flags
                +------+-----------------------------+--------+
                | name |         description         | points |
                +======+=============================+========+
                | 1.1  | This is a description.      | 5      |
                +------+-----------------------------+--------+
                | 1.2  | This is also a description. | 1      |
                +------+-----------------------------+--------+
        
        To submit answers to the server use the 'submit' command, providing
        the flag you are attempting to solve and your answer.
        
        .. code-block::
        
                > submit 1.1 hello
                world! good job!
        
        To view the leaderboard use the 'leaderboard' command. Note, you
        will not appear on the leaderboard until you have at least one
        point.
        
        .. code-block::
        
                > leaderboard
                +----------------+--------+
                |      user      | points |
                +================+========+
                | master         | 42     |
                | rival          | 6      |
                | example_user   | 5      |
                +----------------+--------+
        
        To ask for hints use the 'hintbot' command. He's pretty lazy so he
        might not be awake at the start of the game. Send him the name of
        a flag to ask for a hint, or just chat with him.
        
        .. code-block::
        
               > hintbot Can I have some help with 2.2?
               Have you tried giving the correct answer?
        
        If you want to use an already created user use the 'set_user'
        command and provide a user's uuid.
        
        .. code-block::
        
               > set_user 0786c22d-4ad1-4430-8505-ecd3d00194b2
        
        If you need to change the server hostname from what you are about to
        provide, use the 'set_hostname' command.
        
        .. code-block::
        
               > set_hostname ctf.challenge.com
        
        State
        -----
        This shell uses a sqlite database to save state and settings.
        This database will be created at ``./.CTFshell.db`` by default,
        but can be given a custom path using ``CTFshell -d [path]``.
