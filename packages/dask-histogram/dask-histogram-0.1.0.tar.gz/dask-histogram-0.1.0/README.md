The [boost-histogram](https://github.com/scikit-hep/boost-histogram)
library provides a performant object oriented API for histogramming in
Python. This library adds support for lazy calculations on Dask
collections, built on the foundation of boost-histogram.

**The library is still in development but welcomes testing.**
