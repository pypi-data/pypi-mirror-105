# tanuna

tanuna is a Python package that supports working with dynamic systems. It is
intended to include:

- Continuous time and discrete time systems
- Linear and non-linear systems
- Time-invariant and time-varying systems
- SISO and MIMO systems, including pure sources and pure sinks
- System characterization (such as impulse- and frequency response)
- Controller design

Currently, the focus is on continuous-time LTI systems. Please find
documentation including interesting examples on
[readthedocs](https://tanuna.readthedocs.io).

Furthermore - and maybe foremost - this project serves the author to learn
and try:

- feedback systems
- Distributed revision control (git and github)
- Modern documentation (sphinx and readthedocs)
- Distribution (pypi)
- (maybe) Build servers

The name? Stands for "There Are No Unique Names Anymore" and resulted from an
unsuccessful search for a sensible name that was not used already - well,
almost: "tanuna" seems to be the essive singular form of "tanu". A "tanu" is
a traditional Finnish bonnet worn by women.
