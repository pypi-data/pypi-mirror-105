# GitHacker

#### Desciption

This is a multiple threads tool to detect whether a site has the `.git` folder 
leakage vulnerability. It is able to download the target `.git` folder almost 
completely. This tool also works when the `DirectoryListings` feature is 
disabled. It is worth mentioning that this tool will download almost all files 
of the target git repository and then rebuild them locally, which makes this 
tool State of the art in this area. For example, tools like [githack] just 
simply restore the latest version. With GitHacker's help, you can view the 
developer's commit history, which makes a better understanding of the character 
and psychology of developers, so as to lay the foundation for further code 
audition.
