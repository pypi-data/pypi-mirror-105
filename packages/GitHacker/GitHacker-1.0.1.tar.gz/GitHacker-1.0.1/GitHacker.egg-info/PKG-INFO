Description: # GitHacker
        
        #### Desciption
        
        This is a multiple threads tool to detect whether a site has the `.git` folder 
        leakage vulnerability. It is able to download the target `.git` folder almost 
        completely. This tool also works when the `DirectoryListings` feature is 
        disabled. It is worth mentioning that this tool will download almost all files 
        of the target git repository and then rebuild them locally, which makes this 
        tool State of the art in this area. For example, tools like [githack] just 
        simply restore the latest version. With GitHacker's help, you can view the 
        developer's commit history, which makes a better understanding of the character 
        and psychology of developers, so as to lay the foundation for further code 
        audition.
