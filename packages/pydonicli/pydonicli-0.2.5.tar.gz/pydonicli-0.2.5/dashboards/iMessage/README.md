## The App

## The ELT Workflow

### Extract

### Load

### Transform

#### Refresh View Definitions

#### Staged Tables

## Out-of-band Operations

Any operations not performed in the regularly executed ELT Workflow are considered to be "out of band". These operations are typically staged tables that do not need to be run with each workflow execution, or other operations that require manual handling.

### Out-of-band Staged Tables

## Graphics

All graphics files that underlie the Data Visualizer are found in the **graphics/** folder.
