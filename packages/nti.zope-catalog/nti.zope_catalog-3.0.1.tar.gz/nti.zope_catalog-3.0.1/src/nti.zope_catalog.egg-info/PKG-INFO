        Utilities and extensions for ZODB-based Zope catalogs and indexes.
        
        This builds on both zope.catalog and zc.catalog.
        
        
        =========
         Changes
        =========
        
        3.0.1 (2021-05-13)
        ==================
        
        - Fix the ``ExtentFilteredSet`` to only unindex documents that were
          previously indexed. This avoids an extra ``readCurrent`` call. See
          `issue 12 <https://github.com/NextThought/nti.zope_catalog/issues/12>`_.
        
        
        3.0.0 (2021-05-12)
        ==================
        
        - Add support for Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9.
        
          Note that ``zopyx.txng3.ext`` version 4.0.0, the current version at
          this writing, may or may not build on CPython 3, depending on how
          your compiler and compiler options treat undefined functions.
          See `this issue <https://github.com/zopyx/zopyx.txng3.ext/issues/10>`_.
        
          Also note that both PyPy 3.6 and 3.7 (7.3.4) are known to crash when
          running the test suite. PyPy2 7.3.4 runs the test suite fine.
        
        - When updating indexes in a catalog, first check if the type of each
          object to be visited implements ``INoAutoIndex``. If it does, we can
          avoid prematurely activating persistent ghost objects. See `issue 8
          <https://github.com/NextThought/nti.zope_catalog/issues/8>`_.
        
        - Require ZODB 5 in order to use the new ``prefetch()`` method.
        
        - When adding or updating an index in a catalog, use ZODB's prefetch
          method to grab chunks of object state data from the database. This
          can be substantially faster than making requests one at a time. This
          introduces a new class ``CatalogPrefetchIterator`` that may be
          useful in other circumstances. See `issue 7
          <https://github.com/NextThought/nti.zope_catalog/issues/8>`_.
        
        2.0.0 (2017-11-05)
        ==================
        
        - Rename ``TimestampToNormalized64BitIntNormalizer`` to
          ``TimestampTo64BitIntNormalizer`` for consistency.
        - Make ``TimestampTo64BitIntNormalizer`` subclass
          ``TimestampNormalizer`` for simplicity.
        - Rename ``FloatToNormalized64BitIntNormalizer`` to
          ``PersistentFloatTo64BitIntNormalizer`` for consistency and to
          reflect its purpose.
        - Make ``PersistentFloatTo64BitIntNormalizer`` subclass
          ``FloatTo64BitIntNormalizer``.
        - Add ``IDeferredCatalog`` and an implementation in
          ``DeferredCatalog`` to allow creating catalog objects that don't
          participate in event subscription-based indexing. This replaces
          ``IMetadataIndex``, which is now an alias for this object. See
          `issue 3 <https://github.com/NextThought/nti.zope_catalog/pull/3>`_.
        
        1.0.0 (2017-06-15)
        ==================
        
        - First PyPI release.
        - Add support for Python 3.
        - ``TimestampNormalizer`` also normalizes incoming datetime objects.
        - Fix extent-based queries for NormalizedKeywordIndex.
        - 100% test coverage.
