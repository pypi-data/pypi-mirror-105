        # About
        This script is used in production @ Prisma to generate the required attributions
        for our [license page](https://buyprisma.netlify.app/info/licente.html).
        
        ### How?
        It walks the given directory and searches for license files, and after it's done,
        it will write all of them to a new file, following the given template.
        
        ### Compatibility
        At this time, it's only been tested on JS project (the default folder is `node_modules`), but it should be compatible with anything
         that stores licenses locally.
        
        # Usage
        
        ## Recomanded
        ```py
        from generate_licenses import Generator, Template # <- Or you can use DefaultTemplate
        
        template = Template(
            wrapper_template='<div>\n$ctnt\n</div>',
            title_template='<h1>$ctnt</h1>\n',
            license_template='<pre>\n<code>\n$ctnt\n</code>\n</pre>'
        )
        
        generator = Generator(template, <initial_dir>, <out_file>, <out_separator>)
        generator.write_licenses()
        ```
        
        ### CLI _(Not recomanded)_
        See help: `generate_licenses.py -h`

        ## How does the Templating work?
        
        Let's start with the given example (from above) - That will generate the following:
        ```html
        <div>
        <h1>PACKAGE_NAME</h1>
        <pre>
        <code>
        LICENSE
        </code>
        </pre>
        </div>
        ```
        
        Basically you can write whatever you want, and put `$ctnt` where you want the 
        actual "content" to be put
