### Getting Started

<!-- Getting started with Crest in 5 minutes by following the instructions provided on the <a alt="Link to getting started page of API reference documentation" href="">API reference page</a>. -->

To get you started quickly letâ€™s dive into the necessary steps needed to set up the environment.

#### To use Crest as a Python Library

##### Using Pip

1. Install Crest using python package manager (Make sure pip is installed in your system).

```python 
pip install crest
```

#### To use Crest as a Service

##### Using Conda

1. Download and Install Miniconda from [conda.io](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

2. For Windows, launch Miniconda prompt shell. For MacOS, launch the terminal.

3. Clone the Crest repository. More details can be found at [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

4. Go to "crest" folder in your terminal/prompt shell. Run command.
```python
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate crest
```

5. Install chromedriver. The details can be found in [chromium.org](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).

6. Download and Install google-chrome-stable from [ubuntuupdates.org](https://www.ubuntuupdates.org/package/google_chrome/stable/main/base/google-chrome-stable).

7. Once all the required libraries are installed, go to 'src/crest' folder and run the below command in your terminal/prompt shell. 
```python
FLASK_APP=server.py FLASK_ENV=development flask run --port 3000
```

##### Using Docker

1. Clone the repository. More details can be found at [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

2. Download and Install docker from [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Note: Make sure your docker server as well as crest image is running.

3. Go to "crest" folder in your terminal/prompt shell. Run command.
```python
docker build -t crest .
```

4. Once the docker image is created, run it by executing the following command.
```python
docker container run --name crest_container -p 3000:3000 crest 
```

**Note: A machine learning model will be downloaded from [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/gargam/roberta-base-crest) when you use the Heading Analysis/ Crest Single API for the first time. It will be saved in your system's cache for future use and could take approximately 2 GB of your system's memory.**


### Fine-tune Machine Learning Model

Train the machine learning model to a specific domain:

1. Prepare a labelled dataset in the below format.

| URL           | Title                              | Description                                                                    | Result |
|---------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| http://gov.uk | Tell us whether you accept cookies | We use cookies to collect information about how you use GOV.UK. We use this... | True   |
2. Change the dataset directory path i.e. ['model_params']['training_data_input_file_name'] in the config.py file.
3. Run a python script placed in the `src/crest/utils/` directory by executing the following command:
```python
    python train_model.py
```

Note: Install Apex if you are using fp16 training. Please follow the instructions in  [github.com/NVIDIA/apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex). (Installing Apex from pip has caused issues for several people.)

### Support

Crest is released as open source software and comes with no commercial support.<br />
But since we want to ensure success and recognize that Crest consumers might fall into a range of roles - from developers that are steeped in the conventions of open-source to customers that are more accustomed to commercial offerings, we offer several methods of engaging with the Crest team and community.<br />
For the Crest community, feel free to join our <a alt= "Link to join crest slack channel" href="https://join.slack.com/t/crest-axz6070/shared_invite/zt-q4qom3p2-7FqwoIg2yffUzlpEE7_bcA" target="_blank">Slack channel </a>
