    Speed up reading sets of files - such as multiple days worth of log-per-day
    files.

    Each file is read in a separate thread, up to 8 threads, reading a single
    file using this function won't show any improvement.

    NOTE:
        This compromises ordering for speed

    Parameters:
        items_to_read: list of strings:
            The name of the blobs to read
        reader: BaseReader:
            The Reader object to perform the reading operations
        max_threads: integer (optional):
            The number of threads to use to perform the read with, defaults
            to 4, is limited to 8.
