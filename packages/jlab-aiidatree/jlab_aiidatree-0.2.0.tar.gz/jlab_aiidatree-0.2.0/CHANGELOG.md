# Change Log

## 0.2.0 - 2021-05-14

The extension now interfaces with an AiiDA instance either directly, through an installed aiida-core instance, or via an AiiDA REST server (rather than directly through the PostgreSQL server).
See the README "Connecting to AiiDA" section for details.

Also improved formatting and linting of source code, and added VS Code devcontainer setup.

## 0.1.0 - 2021-05-11
