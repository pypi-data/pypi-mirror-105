# hks_pynetwork
A Python library is built to communicate between objects in internal or external programs.

# How to build
Our library is only supported by Python >=3.7.1. Now we test it only on Python 3.7.1. If you meet any problems, even if with other versions, you could [create an issue](https://github.com/huykingsofm/hks_pynetwork/issues) to notify us. We will solve them as quickly as possible.  

## Create Virtual Environment (optional but IMPORTANT)
*If you had your virtual environment, you can ignore this step.* 

You ought to create a virtual environment to avoid conflicting with other applications on your machine when installing our module. The virtual environment must be installed with [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads).  
I highly recommend you to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) because of its utilities. The command of creating a virtual environment in Anaconda is:
```bash
$ conda create -n your_venv_name
$ conda activate your_venv_name
(your_venv_name) $ _ 
```

Or use `Python venv`:
```bash
$ python -m venv path/to/your/venv
$ path/to/your/venv/Scripts/activate.bat
(your_venv_name) $ _
```

## Method 1: Install the stablest version (PyPI)
```bash
(your_venv_name) $ pip install hks_pynetwork
```

## Method 2: Install the newest version (Github)

```bash
(your_venv_name) $ git clone https://github.com/huykingsofm/hks_pynetwork.git
(your_venv_name) $ cd hks_pynetwork
(your_venv_name) hks_pynetwork $ pip install -e .
```

# How to use
Just use `import` statement and enjoy it. We will write documentation and tutorials as soon as possible so that you can understand our library easier.

```python
from hks_pynetwork import internal
from hks_pynetwork import external
```
