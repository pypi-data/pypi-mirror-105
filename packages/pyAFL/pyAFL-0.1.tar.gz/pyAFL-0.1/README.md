# pyAFL

pyAFL is a AFL (Australian Football League) data fetching libary. It scrapes data from https://afltables.com/ and converts results to structured Python objects for easier analytics.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository locally:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RamParameswaran/pyAFL.git
   ```

## API

- Player
  - [Player()](#Player)
  - [Player.get_player_stats()](#Player.get_player_stats)
- Team
  - [Team()](#Team)
  - [Team.players](#Team.players)
  - [Team.games](#Team.games)
  - [Team.season_stats(year)](#Team.season_stats)

### Player()

Instantiates the Player object. The __init__ method finds the matching player on afltables.com based on the `name` argument string. `name` must be an exact match, in the format "Firstname Lastname" and must be a name listed at https://afltables.com/afl/stats/playersA_idx.html

### Player.get_player_stats()

Pulls player stats (career totals, and season-by-season summary) and presents as a Python object.
This function returns a PlayerStats object with attributes:

- season_stats_total (Pandas dataframe)
- season_stats_average (Pandas dataframe)
- season_results (list of Pandas dataframes)

**Example**

    >>> from pyAFL.players.models import Player
    
    >>> player = Player("Nick Riewoldt")
    >>> player.url
    "https://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/N/Nick_Riewoldt.html"

    >>> stats = player.get_player_stats()
    >>> stats.season_stats_total
                Year      Team         #      GM  ...       MI      1%     BO      GA

### Team()

Instantiates a Team object. pyAFL automatically instantiates Team objects for all current and former AFL teams. They can be imported by their team abbreviation:

    >>> from pyAFL.teams import (ADE, BRI, BRB, CAR, COL, ESS, FIZ, FRE, GEE, GC, GWS, HAW, MEL, NOR, POR, RIC, STK, SYD, UNI, WCE, WBD)
    >>> # or
    >>> from pyAFL.teams import ALL_TEAMS, CURRENT_TEAMS
    
    >>> ADE
        <Team: Adelaide>
        
    >>> CURRENT_TEAMS
        [<Team: Adelaide>, <Team: Brisbane Lions>, <Team: Carlton>, <Team: Collingwood>, <Team: Essendon>, <Team: Fremantle>, <Team: Geelong>, <Team: Gold Coast>, <Team: Greater Western Sydney>, <Team: Hawthorn>, <Team: Melbourne>, <Team: North Melbourne>, <Team: Port Adelaide>, <Team: Richmond>, ...]

### Team.players

Returns a list of all historical players for this team. The return is a list of pyAFL [Player](#Player) objects. These Player objects can be queried to get player stats using the Player classmethods noted above.

    >>> from pyAFL.teams import ADE
    
    >>> # Let's get a list of all players who have every played for Adelaide (i.e. all players from https://afltables.com/afl/stats/teams/adelaide.html)
    >>> ADE.players
        [<Player: Mcleod, Andrew>, <Player: Edwards, Tyson>, <Player: Ricciuto, Mark>, <Player: Hart, Ben>, <Player: Smart, Nigel>, <Player: Goodwin, Simon>, <Player: Bickley, Mark>, <Player: Thompson, Scott>, ...]

### Team.games

Returns a Pandas DataFrame with all historical game results for this team. The DataFrame has a datetime index.

    >>> from pyAFL.teams import ADE
    
    >>> # Let's get all historical game data (i.e. all the data from https://afltables.com/afl/teams/adelaide/allgames.html)
    >>> ADE.games
