# Open Policy Agent Middleware for FastAPI

`fastapi-opa` is an extension to FastAPI that allows you to add a login flow
to your application within minutes using open policy agent and your favourite
identity provider.

```bash
─▄████▄▄░
▄▀█▀▐└─┐░░         FastAPI App
█▄▐▌▄█▄┘██  ---->  @app.get("/")
└▄▄▄▄▄┘███         async def root():  
██▒█▒███▀              return {}
   User                   |                   Identity Provider
    |       ------------------------------>    (e.g. Keycloak)
    |       <------------------------------           |
    |       ---->         |                           |
    |                     |           ---->           |
    |                     |           <----           |
    |                     |           ---------------------------------->  Open Policy Agent
    |                     |           <---------------------------------- 
    |       <-----        |
```

When a user tries to get a response from an endpoint he/she will be redirected
to the identity provider for authorization.
After the authentication the app validates the token provided. Once it was
validated the user information is used to get an OPA decision whether
the user is allowed to get any information from the endpoint.

## Installation

```bash
poetry add [--extras "graphql"] fastapi-opa 
```

## How to get started

:bulb: Checkout the wiki for a complete environment setup with Keycloak and Open Policy Agent:  
[Getting Started with FastAPI app with Authentication and Authorization](https://github.com/busykoala/fastapi-opa/wiki#dev-setup)

The package provides a very easy way to integrate authentication and
authorization. We can decide what authentication flow we inject into the
OPAMiddleware to be able choosing between different flows.

```python
from typing import Dict

from fastapi import FastAPI

from fastapi_opa import OPAConfig
from fastapi_opa import OPAMiddleware
from fastapi_opa.auth import OIDCAuthentication
from fastapi_opa.auth import OIDCConfig

# The hostname of your Open Policy Agent instance
opa_host = "http://localhost:8181"
# In this example we use OIDC authentication flow (using Keycloak)
oidc_config = OIDCConfig(
    well_known_endpoint="http://localhost:8000/auth/realms/example-realm/.well-known/openid-configuration",  # well known endpoint
    app_uri="http://localhost:4000",  # host where this app is running
    client_id="example-client",  # client id of your app configured in the identity provider
    client_secret="bbb4857c-21ba-44a3-8843-1364984a36906",  # the client secret retrieved from your identity provider
)
oidc_auth = OIDCAuthentication(oidc_config)
opa_config = OPAConfig(authentication=oidc_auth, opa_host=opa_host)

app = FastAPI()
# Add OPAMiddleware to the fastapi app
app.add_middleware(OPAMiddleware, config=opa_config)


@app.get("/")
async def root() -> Dict:
    return {
        "msg": "success",
    }
```

## Open Policy Agent

The (validated/authenticated) user token is sent to the Open Policy Agent
with the additional attributes `request_method` and `request_path`.

```json
{
    "input": {
        "exp": 1617466243,
        "iat": 1617465943,
        "auth_time": 1617465663,
        "jti": "9aacb638-70c6-4f0a-b0c8-dbc67f92e3d1",
        "iss": "http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/example-realm",
        "aud": "example-client",
        "sub": "ccf78dc0-e1d6-4606-99d4-9009e74e3ab4",
        "typ": "ID",
        "azp": "david",
        "session_state": "41640fe7-39d2-44bc-818c-a3360b36fb87",
        "at_hash": "2IGw-B9f5910Sll1tnfQRg",
        "acr": "0",
        "email_verified": false,
        "hr": "true",
        "preferred_username": "david",
        "user": "david",
        "subordinates": [],
        "request_method": "GET",
        "request_path": ["finance", "salary", "david"]
    }
}
```

In open policy agent you can now easily create policies using user roles,
routes, or request methods etc.

An example policy (from [the official OPA docs](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.11.0/http-api-authorization/))
for this setup could be like:

```rego
package httpapi.authz

# bob is alice's manager, and betty is charlie's.
subordinates = {"alice": [], "charlie": [], "bob": ["alice"], "betty": ["charlie"]}

# HTTP API request
import input

default allow = false

# Allow users to get their own salaries.
allow {
  some username
  input.request_method == "GET"
  input.request_path = ["finance", "salary", username]
  input.user == username
}

# Allow managers to get their subordinates' salaries.
allow {
  some username
  input.request_method == "GET"
  input.request_path = ["finance", "salary", username]
  subordinates[input.user][_] == username
}
```

## Authentication Flow

These flows are implemented:

- OpenID Connect

If your favourite flow is not provided yet, there is an interface provided to
easily implement it and inject it into OPAMiddleware
(`fastapi_opa.auth.auth_interface.AuthInterface`), or you can open a pull
request if you would like to contribute to the package.

## Custom Payload Enrichment

In `fastapi_opa.opa.opa_config.Injectable` an interface is provided to add
more information to the payload sent to OPA.

The injectables can be added to the `OPAConfig`. Let's look at an example:

```python
class FancyInjectable(Injectable):
    async def extract(self, request: Request) -> List:
        return ["some", "custom", "stuff"]

fancy_inj = FancyInjectable("fancy_key")

opa_config = OPAConfig(
    authentication=oidc_auth, opa_host=opa_host, injectables=[fancy_inj]
)
```

:bulb: For GraphQL there is a ready to use injectable in
`fastapi_opa.opa.enrichment.graphql_enrichment.GraphQLInjectable`

## Roadmap

- Add other authentication flows
