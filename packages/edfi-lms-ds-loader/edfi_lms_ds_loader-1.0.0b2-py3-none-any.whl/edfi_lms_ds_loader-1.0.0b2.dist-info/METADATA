# lms-ds-loader

The Ed-Fi LMS Data Store Loader is a utility for loading CSV files in the
Learning Management System Unified Data Model (LMS-UDM) into a Learning
Management System Data Store (LMS-DS) database.

The application processes each file in the input file system by date order, as
indicated in the file name. If a record is in a file one day, and missing on the
next day, then the system "soft deletes" that record by setting the current
timestamp into the `deletedat` column. Similarly, if a previously soft deleted record
reappears later, the record is "un-soft deleted" and updated with any new values.

This functionality requires that a root level directory only contains files for
one LMS provider. Thus if an education organization uses multiple LMS providers,
then each LMS Extractor needs to write files to a separate, dedicated directory,
and the LMS DS Loader must be run once for each extractor's output directory.

Limitations as of April 2021:

* This tool only supports SQL Server (tested on MSSQL 2019). PostgreSQL support will be added at a future data.

## Getting Started

1. SQL Server support requires the Microsoft ODBC 17 driver, which is newer than
   the ones that come with most operating systems.
   * Windows: `choco install sqlserver-odbcdriver`
   * [Linux
     instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15)
     (has not been tested yet)
1. Requires Python 3.9+ and Poetry.
1. Install required Python packages:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

1. The database account used when running the tool needs to be a member of the
   following roles in the destination database:

   * db_datareader
   * db_datawriter
   * db_ddladmin

Note that the tool automatically manages deployment of the LMS-DS tables into
the destination database, under the `lms` schema.

## Running the Tool

For detailed help, execute `poetry run python edfi_lms_ds_loader -h`.

Sample call using full integrated security, loading from the sample files
directory:

```bash
poetry run python edfi_lms_ds_loader --server localhost --dbname lms_toolkit --useintegratedsecurity --csvpath ../../docs/sample-out
```

## Developer Notes

### Database-Enabled Integration Tests

This package contains SQL Server-integrated tests, in addition to the standard
unit tests. The specialized tests are in the `tests_integration_sql` directory
and they will run automatically if you call `pytest` with no arguments.

Before running the tests, create an empty SQL Server database named
"test_integration_lms_toolkit": `sqlcmd -Q "create database
test_integration_lms_toolkit"`. This is required to run the SQL Server
integration pytests.

To run only the _unit tests_: `poetry run pytest tests`. To run only the
integration tests, `poetry run pytest tests_integration_sql`.

#### Writing New Tests

Please note and follow the existing pattern for database-enabled integration
tests, as this pattern was carefully tuned to support use of database
transactions for rolling back changes and thereby leaving behind a clean
database.

### Dev Operations

1. Style check: `poetry run flake8`
1. Static typing check: `poetry run mypy .`
1. Run unit tests: `poetry run pytest`
1. Run unit tests with code coverage: `poetry run coverage run -m pytest`
1. View code coverage: `poetry run coverage report`

_Also see
[build.py](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Exchange-OSS/LMS-Toolkit/blob/main/docs/build.md)_ for
use of the build script.

### Adding New Migrations

1. Create SQL Server and PostgreSQL SQL scripts under
   `edfi_lms_ds_loader/scripts/<engine name>`, using the same file name for
   both. Start from the artifact created by MetaEd, and then update the script
   with these modifications:
   * Remove the `Id` column and the default constraint for that column.
   * Add a `DeletedAt` column as a nullable `Datetime2`.
   * Duplicate the table definition and prefix the duplicate with "stg_".
   * In the staging table, change the `xyzIdentifier` primary key column name to
     `StagingId`, and leave out the `DeletedAt` column.
1. Use `;` (semi-colon) terminators at the end of each SQL statement for both
   languages. Do not use `GO` in the SQL Server files, as the application is not
   coded to parse it.
1. Add the new script name to the `MIGRATION_SCRIPTS` constant at the top of
   `edfi_lms_ds_loader/migrator.py`.

### Adding New Files Uploads

1. Create the required table and staging table in a new migration.
1. Ensure that the `file-utils` shared library correctly maps the data types for
   the new file.
1. Update the `edfi_lms_ds_loader/loader_facade.py` to pull in the additional
   file type and upload it.
