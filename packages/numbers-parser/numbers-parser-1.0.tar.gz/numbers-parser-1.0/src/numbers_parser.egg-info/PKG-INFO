Description: # numbers-parser
        
        *THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS*
        
        Parsing of Numbers files is still something that is being debugged as the author unpicks the
        data structures of the stored spreadsheets.

        `numbers-parser` is a Python module for parsing [Apple Numbers](https://www.apple.com/numbers/)
        `.numbers` files. It supports Numbers files generated by Numbers version 10.3
        (current as of February 2021).
        
        Numbers uses a proprietary, compressed binary format to store its tables.
        This format is comprised of a zip file containing images, as well as
        [Snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy)-compressed
        [Protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) `.iwa` files containing
        metadata, text, and all other definitions used in the spreadsheet.
        
        
        ## Updates
        
        As `numbers-parser` includes private Protobuf definitions extracted from a copy of Numbers,
        new versions of Numbers will inevitably create `.numbers` files that cannot be read by `numbers-parser`.
        As new versions of Numbers are released, the following steps must be undertaken:
        
        * Run [proto-dump](https://github.com/masaccio/proto-dump) on the new copy of Numbers to dump
          new Proto files.
          * proto-dump assumes version 2.5.0 of Google Protobuf  which may need changes to build on more
            modern OSes.  The version linked here is maintained by the author and tested on recent macOS
        	for both arm64 and x86_64 architectures.
          * Any `.` characters in the Protobuf definitions must be changed to `_` characters manually, or via
            the `rename_proto_files.py` script in the `protos` directory of this repo.
        * Connect to a running copy of `Numbers` with `lldb` (or any other debugger) and manually copy
          and reformat the results of `po [TSPRegistry sharedRegistry]` into `mapping.py`.
          * Versions of macOS >= 10.11 may protect Numbers from being attached to by a debugger -
            to attach, [temporarily disable System IntegrityProtection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/disabling_and_enabling_system_integrity_protection)
            to get this data.
          * The `generate_mapping.py` script in `protos` should help turn the output from this step into a
            recreation of `mapping.py`
        
        Running `make bootstrap` will perform all of these steps and generate the Python protos files as
        well as `mapping.py`. The makefile assumes that [proto-dump](https://github.com/masaccio/proto-dump)
        is in a repo parallel to this one, but the make variable `PROTO_DUMP` can be overridden to pass
        the path to a working version of `proto-dump`.
        
        ## Credits
        
        `numbers-parser` was built by [Jon Connell](http://github.com/masaccio) but derived enormously
        from [prior work](https://github.com/psobot/keynote-parser) by [Peter Sobot](https://petersobot.com).
        Both modules are derived from [previous work](https://github.com/obriensp/iWorkFileFormat/blob/master/Docs/index.md)
        by [Sean Patrick O'Brien](http://www.obriensp.com).
        
        Decoding the data structures inside Numbers files was helped greatly by
        [previous work](https://github.com/slott56/Stingray-Reader) by [Steven Lott](https://github.com/slott56).
