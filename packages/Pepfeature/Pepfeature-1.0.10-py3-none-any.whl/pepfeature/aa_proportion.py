"""
    This module contains methods to Calculate all the proportion (out of 1) of each Amino Acid in the peptide. Results
    returned as CSV(s) or DataFrame.

    Methods user can call from this module:

    Calculates the proportion (out of 1) od each Amino-Acid in the peptides (Amino Acid Sequences) chunk by chunk of the inputted 'dataframe'.

    feat_Prop_C, ..., feat_Prop_Y.

    This is a Ram efficient way of calculating the Features as the features are calculated on a single chunk of the dataframe (of

    is deleted freeing up RAM.
