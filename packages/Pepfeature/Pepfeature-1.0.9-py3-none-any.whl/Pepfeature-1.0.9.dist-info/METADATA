# Pepfeature V1.0.8
### _A package that consists of functions for calculating epitope/peptide features for prediction purposes_


### What is it

**Pepfeature** is a Python package providing routines for calculating peptide features on a given amino acid sequence.
These features can be used for macine learning purposes such as classification for epitiope prediction.

The features it can calculate for a given Amino Acid string sequence are:

| No. |                      Feature                     | Explanation and references to be found in this section of Report.pdf | Calculated in Pepfeature package's Python Module |

## Pepfeature Requirements
**Required Software/Tools:**  
- Tested on Python 3.8 (other Python 3 versions probably work too)

**Required Package Dependencies:**  
(Pepfeature has been tested on these versions of the dependancies. More recent/older versions of these dependancies may also be compatible with the Package.)
- et-xmlfile v1.1.0
- setuptools v56.0.0
- numpy v1.20.2
- openpyxl v3.0.7
- pandas v1.2.4
- python-dateutil v2.8.1
- pytz v2021.1
- six v1.15.0


## Installation

```
pip install Pepfeature
```
(All dependancies are expected to be automatically installed asswell with this 'pip install pepfeature' command.)
The source code is currently hosted on GitHub at: https://github.com/essakh/pepfeature

## Example Use
**NOTE: The Github contains an 'examples.py' in the root folder with many example use cases**

**Ensure at all times that any lines of code that utilize this package are executed within the code block:**
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
```
Example:
```python
import pepfeature as pep
import pandas

df = pd.read_csv('pepfeature/data/Sample_Data.csv')

#Use of pepfeature
if __name__ == '__main__':
    #Calculate all features on df
    df_feat = pep.aa_all_feat.calc_df(dataframe=df, aa_column='Info_window_seq', Ncores=4, k=2)

    print(df_feat) #print the data frame to console
```

## Understanding the API

The API interface consists of calling two functions from 9 possibile modules, an overview of the modules and their two callable functions are illustrated in the figure below:

![line of code](pictures/pepfeature_public_modules_and_functions.PNG)

Thus, if in your python script you:
```python
import pepfeature
```
Then you will have the following possible API interfacing options, as illustrated in the image below:

![line of code](pictures/generic_string.PNG)
Please see pepfeature/examples.py on the Github repo for example use cases.

## The Data Frame format to input into interface functions

The interface functions are calc_csv & calc_df. They have been detailed in respect to each module in the following section "Functions documentation",

Both the interface functions, viz. calc_csv & calc_df always take an argument 'dataframe' and 'aa_column' in all cases.

The 'dataframe' parameter of both the calc_csv() & calc_df() functions require a pandas Data frame* with at least one column that consists of amino acid sequences; this column's name you must pass as the 'aa_column' parameter into calc_csv() & calc_df() aswell. 
**Note: The Amino Acid sequences to calculate features on can be of varying sizes/lengths.**

*in the example code shown in the 'Example Use' section of this documentation. The line 
```python
df = pd.read_csv('pepfeature/data/Sample_Data.csv') 
```
converts Sample_Data.csv into a pandas Data Frame to then feed into calc_csv() & calc_df().
This Sample_Data.csv exists in the location pepfeature/data/Sample_Data.csv relative from the root of the Github repo. This csv can be used as sample data to try out the package and to gauge what is meant by "A pandas DataFrame that contains a column/feature that is composed of purely Amino-Acid sequences (pepides).".

## Functions documentation

    - Path to folder for saving the output as CSV
- **`aa_column`** : `str`,  `Default='Info_window_seq'`
    - Name of column in dataframe input consisting of the Amino-Acid sequences to process.
- **`Ncores`** : `int`,  `Default=1`
    - Number of cores to use for executing function (multiprocessing).
- **`chunksize`** : `int`,  `Default=None`
    - Number of rows to be processed at a time. (Where a 'None' object denotes no chunks but the entire dataframe to be processed)


#### pepfeature.aa_porportion.calc_df
Calculates the proportion (out of 1) of each aminoacid in the peptides (Amino Acid Sequences).

Results appended as a new column named feat_Prop_{aa letter} e.g. feat_Prop_A, feat_Prop_C, ..., feat_Prop_Y.

```python
pepfeature.aa_porportion.calc_df(dataframe, Ncores = 1, aa_column= 'Info_window_seq')
```
 **Parameters:**
- **`dataframe`** : `Pandas DataFrame object`
    - A pandas DataFrame that contains a column/feature that is composed of purely Amino-Acid sequences (pepides).
- **`Ncores`** : `int`,  `Default=1`
    - Number of cores to use for executing function (multiprocessing).
- **`aa_column`** : `str`,  `Default='Info_window_seq'`
    - Name of column in dataframe input consisting of the Amino-Acid sequences to process.

 **Returns:**
 - **`Pandas DataFrame object`**
    - A Pandas DataFrame containing the calculated features appended as new columns.

### aa_seq_entropy
This module contains functions to calculate the entropy of given amino acid sequence
#### pepfeature.aa_seq_entropy.calc_csv
Calculates the entropy of given amino acid sequences chunk by chunk from the inputted 'dataframe'.

It saves each processed chunk as a CSV(s).

Results appended as a new column named feat_seq_entropy

This is a Ram efficient way of calculating the Features as the features are calculated on a single chunk of the dataframe (of chunksize number of rows) at a time and when a chunk has been been processed and saved as a CSV, then the chunk is deleted freeing up RAM.
```python
pepfeature.aa_seq_entropy.calc_csv(dataframe, save_folder, aa_column = 'Info_window_seq', Ncores = 1, chunksize = None)
```
 **Parameters:**
- **`dataframe`** : `Pandas DataFrame object`
    - A pandas DataFrame that contains a column/feature that is composed of purely Amino-Acid sequences (pepides).
- **`save_folder`** : `str`
    - Path to folder for saving the output as CSV
- **`aa_column`** : `str`,  `Default='Info_window_seq'`
    - Name of column in dataframe input consisting of the Amino-Acid sequences to process.
- **`Ncores`** : `int`,  `Default=1`
    - Number of cores to use for executing function (multiprocessing).
- **`chunksize`** : `int`,  `Default=None`
    - Number of rows to be processed at a time. (Where a 'None' object denotes no chunks but the entire dataframe to be processed)


#### pepfeature.aa_seq_entropy.calc_df
Calculates the entropy of given amino acid sequences

Results appended as a new column named feat_seq_entropy
```python
pepfeature.aa_seq_entropy.calc_df(dataframe, Ncores = 1, aa_column= 'Info_window_seq')
```
 **Parameters:**
- **`dataframe`** : `Pandas DataFrame object`
    - A pandas DataFrame that contains a column/feature that is composed of purely Amino-Acid sequences (pepides).

    - Number of cores to use for executing function (multiprocessing).
- **`aa_column`** : `str`,  `Default='Info_window_seq'`
    - Name of column in dataframe input consisting of the Amino-Acid sequences to process.

 **Returns:**
 - **`Pandas DataFrame object`**
    - A Pandas DataFrame containing the calculated features appended as new columns.
