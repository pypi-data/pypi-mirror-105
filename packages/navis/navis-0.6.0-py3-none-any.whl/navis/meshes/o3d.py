def simplify_mesh_open3d(x, F, method='quadric', inplace=False, **kwargs):
    """Simplify mesh using open3d.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x :         MeshNeuron | Volume | Trimesh
                Mesh object to simplify.
    F :         float | int
                For method `quadric` this is the target face count (integer).
                For method `cluster` this is the size of the voxel within which
                vertices are pooled (larger t = coarser mesh).
    method :    "quadric" | "cluster"
                Which method to use for simplification: either Quadric Error
                Metric Decimation (by Garland and Heckbert) or vertex clustering.
                Note that the intepretation of ``F`` depends on the method.
    inplace :   bool
                If True, will perform simplication on ``x``. If False, will
                simplify and return a copy.
    **kwargs
                Keyword arguments are passed through to open3d's
                ``simplify_quadric_decimation`` and ``simplify_vertex_clustering``,
                respectively.

    Returns
    -------
    simp
                Simplified mesh object.
