    Parameters
    ----------
    a,b :       TreeNeuron | NeuronList
                Neuron(s) for which to compute cable within distance. It is
                highly recommended to resample neurons to guarantee an even
                sampling rate. Also note that neurons need to have unique IDs.
    dist :      int | float, optional
                Maximum distance. If the neurons have their `.units` set, you
                can also provides this as a string such as "2 microns".
    method :    'min' | 'max' | 'avg'
                Method by which to calculate the overlapping cable between
                two cables::

                  Assuming that neurons A and B have 300 and 150 um of cable
                  within given distances:

                    1. 'min' returns 150
                    2. 'max' returns 300
                    3. 'avg' returns 225

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
            Matrix in which neurons A are rows, neurons B are columns. Cable
            within distance is given in microns::

    See Also
    --------
    :func:`navis.resample_neuron`
                Use to resample neurons before calculating overlap.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import navis
    >>> nl = navis.example_neurons(4)
    >>> # Resample to 1 micron
    >>> nl_res = nl.resample('1 micron', inplace=False)
    >>> # Get overlapping cable within 2 microns
    >>> ol = navis.cable_overlap(nl_res[:2], nl_res[2:], dist='2 microns')
