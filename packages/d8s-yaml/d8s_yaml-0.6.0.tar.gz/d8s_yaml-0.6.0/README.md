Democritus functions<sup>[1]</sup> for working with YAML.

[1] Democritus functions are <i>simple, effective, modular, well-tested, and well-documented</i> Python functions.

We use `d8s` (pronounced "dee-eights") as an abbreviation for `democritus` (you can read more about this [here](https://github.com/democritus-project/roadmap#what-is-d8s)).

## Installation

```
pip install d8s-yaml
```

## Usage

You import the library like:

```python
from d8s_yaml import *
```

Once imported, you can use any of the functions listed below.

## Functions

  - ```python
    def yaml_files(path, *, include_yml_extensions: bool = False):
        """."""
    ```
  - ```python
    def yaml_read(yaml_data: str):
        """."""
    ```
  - ```python
    def is_yaml(possible_yaml_data: str) -> bool:
        """."""
    ```
  - ```python
    def yaml_write(data: Json, **kwargs) -> str:
        """."""
    ```
  - ```python
    def yaml_clean(yaml_data: str) -> str:
        """Standardize the given yaml data."""
    ```
  - ```python
    def yaml_standardize(yaml_data: str) -> str:
        """Standardize the given yaml data by reading and writing it."""
    ```
  - ```python
    def yaml_sort(yaml_data: str) -> str:
        """."""
    ```
