Description: 
                Python Trello API Wrapper
                =========================
        
                This library is a Python wrapper around the [Trello](https://trello.com/) REST API.
        
                Requires Python 3.6 or later.
        
                If you wish to use this with Python 2 or Python 3.5 or lower, please use version 0.9.4.
        
                Getting Started
                ---------------
        
                To use the Python API, first install it from PyPI using `pip`:
        
                    pip install trello
        
                or from source:
        
                    python setup.py install
        
                Once you have it installed, get an API key from [https://trello.com/app-key](https://trello.com/app-key).
        
                    >>> from trello import TrelloApi
                    >>> trello = TrelloApi(TRELLO_APP_KEY)
                    >>> trello.boards.get('4d5ea62fd76aa1136000000c')
                    {
                        "closed": false, 
                        "desc": "Trello board used by the Trello team to track work on Trello.  How meta!
        
        The development of the Trello API is being tracked at https://trello.com/api
        
        The development of Trello Mobile applications is being tracked at https://trello.com/mobile", 
                        "id": "4d5ea62fd76aa1136000000c", 
                        "idOrganization": "4e1452614e4b8698470000e0", 
                        "name": "Trello Development", 
                        "pinned": true, 
                        "prefs": {
                            "comments": "public", 
                            "invitations": "members", 
                            "permissionLevel": "public", 
                            "voting": "public"
                        }, 
                        "url": "https://trello.com/board/trello-development/4d5ea62fd76aa1136000000c"
                    }
        
                Because the Trello development board is public, we didn't need a user's token, but if we want to access private boards, we'll have to have one. We can get it by calling:
        
                    >>> trello.get_token_url('My App', expires='30days', write_access=True)
                        'https://trello.com/1/authorize?key=TRELLO_APP_KEY&name=My+App&expiration=30days&response_type=token&scope=read,write'
        
                If you send your user to the resulting URL, it will ask them to allow your app access to their account, and then it will give them a token (64-digit hex string) that they will pass back to your app.
        
                    >>> trello.set_token(user_token)
        
                (*Note: Trello does support OAuth, but the Python API does not have any support for it yet.*)
        
                Once you have set the user's token, all calls to the API will include that token, as if the user was logged in.
