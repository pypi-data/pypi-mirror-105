Description: # studenttmixture
        
        Mixtures of multivariate Student's t distributions are widely used for clustering
        data that may contain outliers, but scipy and scikit-learn do not at present
        offer classes for fitting Student's t mixture models. This package provides classes
        for:
        
        1) Modeling / clustering a dataset using a finite mixture of multivariate Student's
        t distributions;
        2) Modeling / clustering a dataset using an infinite mixture of Student's t-
        distributions (a Dirichlet process; fit using a variational approximation).
        
        (1) is available in version 0.0.1.1, (2) will come in version 0.0.2.
