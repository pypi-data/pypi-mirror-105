Description: # DFGraph

        [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/willi-z/dfgraph/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=JVKPGLBT3J)](https://codecov.io/gh/willi-z/dfgraph)
        
        The `directed and flexible graph` is part of [DigiFors](https://digifors.de/) effort
        to contribute to the analysing and detection of content and context dependent information.
        'DFGraph' is a simple, but powerful graph based database library based on the `sqlalchemy` library.
        Its main purpose is to store data from large datasets and allows manipulate, connect and detect content.
        This allows for more flexible conversion and detection processes.  
        
        ## Installation
        
        `pip install dfgraph`
        
        ## Usage
        
        See the `examples/` files for some simple use-cases and implementations.
        
        ## Testing
        till `pip 21.3`:
        ```
        pip install --use-feature=in-tree-build -e .
        ```
        `pip 21.3+`:
        ```
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ```
        coverage run --source=src -m pytest && coverage report -m
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        `dfgraph` comes with two main classes: `Node` and `Relationship`.
        It was designed to represent Data from Databases
