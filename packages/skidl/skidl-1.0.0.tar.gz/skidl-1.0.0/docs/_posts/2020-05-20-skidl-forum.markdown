I created a [Discourse forum for SKiDL](https://skidl.discourse.group/).
There, you can ask questions about SKiDL and post about projects you're doing with it.
This will probably be a more convenient channel for such things rather
than opening issues on the SKiDL GitHub repo.

Give it a try and let me know what you think (**on the forum, of course**)!
