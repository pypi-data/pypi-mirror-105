I'm releasing version 0.0.30 of SKiDL today!
It has some new features I'm excited about:

* A new `@package` decorator to make subcircuits act like `Parts`.
* A new `tee()` function for creating T-junctions in networks.
* Custom ERCs can now be added using the new `erc_assert()` function.
* Substring matching in pin names can now be enabled/disabled.

I'll have some upcoming blog posts about these in the near future.
