It's been almost eleven months since I released a new version of SKiDL
(not counting updates to the Github repo).
So here's a new one: version 0.0.27.
You can install it using pip just like all the other releases.

Check out the changes in this version [here](https://github.com/xesscorp/skidl/blob/master/HISTORY.rst).
I didn't quite get everything I wanted into a useable state
(like **design notes** and **net classes**), but I figured it was better to
release what I had to fix some existing bugs.
