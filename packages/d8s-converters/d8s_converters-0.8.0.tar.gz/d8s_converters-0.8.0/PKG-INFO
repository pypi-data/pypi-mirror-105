        Democritus functions<sup>[1]</sup> for easily converting dates, times, temperatures, and distances.
        
        [1] Democritus functions are <i>simple, effective, modular, well-tested, and well-documented</i> Python functions.
        
        We use `d8s` (pronounced "dee-eights") as an abbreviation for `democritus` (you can read more about this [here](https://github.com/democritus-project/roadmap#what-is-d8s)).
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install d8s-converters
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        You import the library like:
        
        ```python
        from d8s_converters import *
        ```
        
        Once imported, you can use any of the functions listed below.
