        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        substanceReference: A pointer to another substance, as a resource or just a representational code.

        substanceCodeableConcept: A pointer to another substance, as a resource or just a representational code.

        relationship: For example "salt to parent", "active moiety", "starting material".

        isDefining: For example where an enzyme strongly bonds with a particular substance, this
            is a defining relationship for that enzyme, out of several possible substance
            relationships.

        amountQuantity: A numeric factor for the relationship, for instance to express that the salt
            of a substance has some percentage of the active substance in relation to some
            other.

        amountRange: A numeric factor for the relationship, for instance to express that the salt
            of a substance has some percentage of the active substance in relation to some
            other.

        amountRatio: A numeric factor for the relationship, for instance to express that the salt
            of a substance has some percentage of the active substance in relation to some
            other.

        amountString: A numeric factor for the relationship, for instance to express that the salt
            of a substance has some percentage of the active substance in relation to some
            other.

        amountRatioLowLimit: For use when the numeric.

        amountType: An operator for the amount, for example "average", "approximately", "less
            than".

        source: Supporting literature.
