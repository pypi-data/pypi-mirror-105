# AALpy - An Active Automata Learning Library

AALpy is a light-weight active automata learning library written in pure Python. 
You can start learning automata in just a few lines of code. 

Whether you work with regular languages or you would like to learn models of 
reactive systems, AALpy supports a wide range of modeling formalisms, including 
**deterministic**, **non-deterministic**, and **stochastic automata**. 

<center>

| Automata Type   |      Supported Formalisms      |  Features |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| Deterministic     |  Deterministic Finite Automata<br />Mealy Machines<br />Moore Machines | Counterexample Processing<br />Seamless Caching<br />11 Eq. Oracles |
| Non-Deterministic |    Observable Non-Deterministic FSM <br /> Abstracted Non-Deterministic FSM|   Size Reduction Trough Abstraction<br />|
| Stochastic        |  Markov Decision Processes<br />Stochastic Mealy Machines |    Counterexample Processing<br />Row/Cell Compatability Metrics<br />Model Checking with PRISM|

</center>

<!---
You can use it to learn **deterministic finite automata**, **Moore machines**, 
and **Mealy machines** of deterministic systems. 
If the system that you would like to learn shows non-deterministic or
stochastic behavior, AALpy allows you to learn **observable
nondeterministic finite-state machines**, **Markov decision processes**, 
or **stochastic Mealy machines**.

Finally, support for learning **abstracted non-deterministic Mealy machines** 
enables efficient learning of system models with large input space.
--->

AALpy enables efficient learning by providing a **large set of equivalence oracles**, implementing various conformance testing strategies. Learning 
is mostly based on Angluin's [L* algorithm](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/teaching/s10/papers/angluin87.pdf), for which AALpy supports a 
selection of optimizations, including **efficient counterexample processing** and **caching**.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install AALpy.
```bash
pip install aalpy
```
The minimum required version of Python is 3.6.  
Ensure that you have [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) installed and added to your path if you want to visualize models.

For manual installation, clone the master and install the following dependency.
```bash
pip install pydot
# and to install the library
python setup.py install
```

[Examples.py](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/blob/master/Examples.py) contains many examples demonstrating all AALpy functionality are presented. 

## Usage

All automata learning procedures follow this high-level approach:
- [Define the input alphabet and system under learning (SUL)](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/SUL-Interface,-or-How-to-Learn-Your-Systems)
- [Choose the equivalence oracle](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/Equivalence-Oracles)
- [Run the learning algorithm](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/Setting-Up-Learning)

For more detailed examples, check out:
- [How to learn Regex with AALpy](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/SUL-Interface%2C-or-How-to-Learn-Your-Systems/_edit#example---regexsul)
- [How to learn MQTT with AALpy](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/SUL-Interface,-or-How-to-Learn-Your-Systems#example---mqtt)
- [Interactive Examples](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/tree/master/notebooks)
- [Examples.py](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/blob/master/Examples.py)

[Examples.py](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/blob/master/Examples.py) contains examples covering almost the whole AALpy's functionality, and it is a great starting point/reference.

The following snippet demonstrates a short example in which an automaton is either [loaded](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/Loading,Saving,-Syntax-and-Visualization-of-Automata) or [randomly generated](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/Generation-of-Random-Automata) and then [learned](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/Setting-Up-Learning).
```python
from aalpy.utils import load_automaton_from_file, save_automaton_to_file, visualize_automaton, generate_random_dfa
from aalpy.SULs import DfaSUL
from aalpy.oracles import RandomWalkEqOracle
from aalpy.learning_algs import run_Lstar

# load an automaton
# automaton = load_automaton_from_file('path_to_the_file.dot', automaton_type='dfa')

# or randomly generate one
random_dfa = generate_random_dfa(alphabet=[1,2,3,4,5],num_states=20, num_accepting_states=8)
big_random_dfa = generate_random_dfa(alphabet=[1,2,3,4,5],num_states=2000, num_accepting_states=500)

# get input alphabet of the automaton
alphabet = random_dfa.get_input_alphabet()

# create a SUL instance for the automaton/system under learning
sul = DfaSUL(random_dfa)

# define the equivalence oracle
eq_oracle = RandomWalkEqOracle(alphabet, sul, num_steps=5000, reset_prob=0.09)

# start learning
learned_dfa = run_Lstar(alphabet, sul, eq_oracle, automaton_type='dfa')

# save automaton to file and visualize it
save_automaton_to_file(learned_dfa, path='Learned_Automaton', file_type='dot')

# visualize automaton
visualize_automaton(learned_dfa)
# or just print its DOT representation
print(learned_dfa)
```

To make experiments reproducible, define a random seed at the beginning of your program.
```Python
from random import seed
seed(2) # all experiments will be reproducible
```
