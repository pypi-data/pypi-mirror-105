  and [subscribe](https://cKnowledge.io/register) for our newsletter!
* We have finished prototyping the [CK concept](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01149.pdf)
  and successfully used it to automate  [MLPerf inference benchmark submissions for edge devices](https://cKnowledge.io/solutions)
  and the design space exploration of [efficient ML/SW/HW stacks](https://cknowledge.io/c/result/crowd-benchmarking-mlperf-inference-classification-mobilenets-all)
  in terms of speed, accuracy, energy and costs.

## Overview

Collective Knowledge framework (CK) helps to organize software projects
as a database of reusable components with common automation actions
and extensible meta descriptions based on [FAIR principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)
(findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability)
as described in this article: [[short pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07161)] 
[[longer journal version](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01149.pdf)].

Our goal is to help researchers and practitioners share, reuse and extend their knowledge
in the form of portable workflows, automation actions and reusable artifacts with a common API, CLI,
and meta description. See how CK supports collaborative and reproducible research:
* [AI/ML/MLPerf automation workflows and components from the community](https://github.com/ctuning/ck-ml);
* [Real-world use cases](https://cKnowledge.org/partners.html) from MLPerf, Arm, General Motors, IBM, the Raspberry Pi foundation, ACM and other great partners;
* [Reddit discussion about reproducing 150 papers](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ioq8do/n_reproducing_150_research_papers_the_problems);
* Our reproducibility initiatives: [methodology](https://cTuning.org/ae), [checklist](https://ctuning.org/ae/submission_extra.html), [events](https://cKnowledge.io/events).

## Installation

Follow [this guide](https://ck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/installation.html) 
to install CK framework on your platform.

CK supports the following platforms:

|               | As a host platform | As a target platform |
|---------------|:------------------:|:--------------------:|
| Generic Linux | ✓ | ✓ |
| Linux (Arm)   | ✓ | ✓ |
| Raspberry Pi  | ✓ | ✓ |
| MacOS         | ✓ | ± |
| Windows       | ✓ | ✓ |
| Android       | ± | ✓ |
| iOS           | TBD | TBD |
| Bare-metal (edge devices)   | - | ± |

## Example (without Docker)

Here we show how to pull a GitHub repo in the CK format 
and use a unified CK interface to compile and run 
any program (image corner detection in our case)
with any compatible data set on any compatible platform:

```bash
python3 -m pip install ck

ck pull repo --url=https://github.com/ctuning/ck-crowdtuning

ck ls program:*susan*

ck search dataset --tags=jpeg

ck detect soft --tags=compiler,gcc
ck detect soft --tags=compiler,llvm

ck show env --tags=compiler

ck compile program:cbench-automotive-susan --speed

ck run program:cbench-automotive-susan --cmd_key=corners --repeat=1 --env.MY_ENV=123 --env.TEST=xyz
```

You can check output of this program in the following directory:
```bash
cd `ck find program:cbench-automotive-susan`/tmp
ls -l

tmp-output.tmp - image with detected corners (rename to ppm to view it)
```

Check [CK docs](https://ck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/introduction.html) for further details.

## Example (with Docker)

We have prepared a CK container with [AI and ML components](https://github.com/ctuning/ai): 
[[Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/ctuning/ck-ai)], [[CK meta](https://github.com/ctuning/ai/tree/main/docker/ck-ai)]

You can start it as follows:

```bash
docker run --rm -it ctuning/ck-ai:ubuntu-20.04
```

You can then prepare and run [portable AI/ML workflows](https://cKnowledge.io/solutions) 
and [program pipelines](https://cKnowledge.io/programs).

## Contributions

Users can extend the CK functionality via [CK modules](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/tree/master/ck/repo/module) 
or external [GitHub reposities](https://cKnowledge.io/repos) in the CK format
as described [here](https://ck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/typical-usage.html).

Please check [this documentation](https://ck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/how-to-contribute.html)
if you want to extend the CK core functionality and [modules](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/tree/master/ck/repo/module). 

Note, that we plan to [redesign the CK core](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/projects/1) 
to be more pythonic (we wrote the first prototype without OO to be able 
to port to bare-metal devices in C but we decided not to do it at the end).
We also plan to relicense the framework to Apache 2.0.
