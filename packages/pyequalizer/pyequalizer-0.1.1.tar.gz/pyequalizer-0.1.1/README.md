pyequalizer
=======================

This repo is a python equalizer which is implemented by scipy.
And, the following function is the main one you will use in this package. 
```
y, sr = librosa.load(input_file, sr=44100)
y = equalizer(y, sr, start_iv=200, end_iv=8000, num_iv=100, peak_scale=20, peak_iv = 20, type=type_f)
```
where **start_iv, end_iv** is the frequencys equalizer starts to work and ends;
**num_iv** is the number how many interval will be in. Generally, it means how smooth the equalize curve is.
**peak_scale** is how much will the signal be enhanced.
**peak_iv** is the interval where the peak of equalizing curve is
**type** means the equalizing curve shape. We currently provide "parabola" and "linear".
