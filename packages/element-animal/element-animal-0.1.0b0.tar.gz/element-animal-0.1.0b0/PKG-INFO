Description: # DataJoint Element - Animal
        
        There are two modules in `element-animal`:
        + subject: contains the basic information of subject, including Strain, Line, Subject, Zygosity, and SubjectDeath information
        + genotyping: this module is designed for labs that keep track of colony management and genotyping results, containing information of breeding, weaning, housing, and genotyping.
        
        See [Background](Background.md) for the background information and development timeline.

        ## Element usage
        
        + `element-animal` is not a complete workflow by itself, but rather a modular design of tables and dependencies that can be flexibly attached to any DataJoint workflow.
        + See the [workflow-animal](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-animal) repository for example usage of `element-animal`.
        
        + Also refer to the [workflow-calcium-imaging](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-calcium-imaging) and [workflow-array-ephys](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-array-ephys) repositories for example usages of `element-animal` when combining with other elements.
        
        + See the [datajoint-elements](https://github.com/datajoint/datajoint-elements) repository for a detailed description of the DataJoint elements and workflows.
