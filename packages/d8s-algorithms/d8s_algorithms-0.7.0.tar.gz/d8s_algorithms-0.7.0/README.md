Democritus functions<sup>[1]</sup> for working with algorithms.

[1] Democritus functions are <i>simple, effective, modular, well-tested, and well-documented</i> Python functions.

We use `d8s` (pronounced "dee-eights") as an abbreviation for `democritus` (you can read more about this [here](https://github.com/democritus-project/roadmap#what-is-d8s)).

## Installation

```
pip install d8s-algorithms
```

## Usage

You import the library like:

```python
from d8s_algorithms import *
```

Once imported, you can use any of the functions listed below.

## Functions

  - ```python
    def amb(validation_function: Callable[..., bool], *args: Any) -> Iterable[Any]:
        """."""
    ```
  - ```python
    def depth_first_traverse(
        data: Any,
        get_children_function: Callable[[Any], Optional[Iterable]],
        *,
        collect_items_function: Optional[Callable[[Any], Any]] = None
    ) -> Iterable[Any]:
        """Traverse the data in a depth-first manner.
    
    The get_children_function specifies how children will be identified from each node of the data.
    The collect_items_function, if provided, allows you to collect items from the data by...
     returning them from the collect_items_function."""
    ```
  - ```python
    def breadth_first_traverse(
        data: Any,
        get_children_function: Callable[[Any], Optional[Iterable]],
        *,
        collect_items_function: Optional[Callable[[Any], Any]] = None
    ) -> Iterable[Any]:
        """Traverse the data in a breadth-first manner.
    
    The get_children_function specifies how children will be identified from each node of the data.
    The collect_items_function, if provided, allows you to collect items from the data by...
     returning them from the collect_items_function."""
    ```
  - ```python
    def genetic_algorithm_run(
        data: Iterable[Any],
        scoring_function: Callable[[Any], Union[int, float]],
        selection_function: Callable[[Dict[Any, Union[int, float]]], Iterable[Any]],
        mutation_function: Callable[[Iterable[Any]], Iterable[Any]],
        max_epochs: int,
    ) -> Dict[Any, Union[int, float]]:
        """."""
    ```
  - ```python
    def genetic_algorithm_best_mutation_function(
        starting_values: Iterable[Any],
        generations: int,
        scoring_function: Callable[[Any], Union[int, float]],
        mutation_functions: List[Callable[[Any], Any]],
    ):
        """Find the best mutation function.
    
    The best function is the one which produces values from the starting values...
     that score the highest (as measured by the scoring_function) after generations."""
    ```
