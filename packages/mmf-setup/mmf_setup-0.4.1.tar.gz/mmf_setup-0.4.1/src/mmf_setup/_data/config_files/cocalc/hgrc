# Here we set the username from the variable LC_HG_USERNAME.  To ensure this is
# properly set, I recommend adding something like the following to your ssh
# config file:
#
# ~/.ssh/config
#
#    Host smc*
#      ForwardAgent yes
#      SendEnv LC_HG_USERNAME
#    Host smcproject1
#      HostName compute5-us.sagemath.com
#      User 08ef79bc1...
#
# etc.  Then if you set $LC_HG_USERNAME appropriately on your local computer,
# it will be pushed to the SMC servers when you log in.
