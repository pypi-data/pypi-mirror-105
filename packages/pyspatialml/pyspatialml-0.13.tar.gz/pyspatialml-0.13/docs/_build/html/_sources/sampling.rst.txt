Random Sampling
***************

Random Uniform Sampling
=======================

For many spatial models, it is common to take a random sample of the predictors
to represent a single class (i.e. an environmental background or pseudo-absences
in a binary classification model). The sample function is supplied in the
sampling module for this purpose:

::

    # extract training data using a random sample
    df_rand = stack.sample(size=1000, random_state=1)
    df_rand.plot()


Stratified Random Sampling
==========================

The sample function also enables stratified random sampling based on passing a
categorical raster dataset to the strata argument. The categorical raster should
spatially overlap with the dataset to be sampled, but it does not need to be of
the same grid resolution. This raster should be passed as a opened rasterio
dataset:

::

    with rasterio.open(nc.strata) as strata:

        df_strata = stack.sample(size=5, strata=strata, random_state=1)
        df_strata = df_strata.dropna()

        fig, ax = plt.subplots()

        ax.imshow(
            data=strata.read(1, masked=True),
            extent=rasterio.plot.plotting_extent(strata),
            cmap='tab10')

        df_strata.plot(ax=ax, markersize=20, color='white')
        plt.show()
